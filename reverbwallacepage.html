    <h3>The History of EMT and Reverb -Will Shanks</h3>

    <p> There has always been a bit of controversy over reverb—particularly artificial reverb. Some purists still avoid it like the plague, while others embrace it as yet another creative tool in the audio engineer's palette. But let's backtrack to a time before digital devices, plates, and even chambers to the beginning of the controversy early in the history of audio recording...
    In the beginning of electric recording around the mid-twenties, recorded reverb was essentially the audible byproduct of a physical distance between a sound source and a microphone. Record companies sought out appropriate rooms for a desired effect. Right from the outset of early recording, those early pioneers were already working with mic placement and rooms for a desired effect! But around the early to mid-thirties the jukebox was introduced—a great invention, but the thirties were not yet a time for stellar playback systems, let alone recording equipment; and the early jukebox suffered from the early technology. But hey, they had to start somewhere! At the time, reverb from room ambience was practically banned from studios due to how it affected the performance of the jukeboxes. This is the primary reason most recordings from the mid-thirties until the fifties are, by design, "dry."

As recording and playback equipment improved, so did the opportunities to experiment with new recording techniques, as well as new marketing ploys for playback resellers: Enter the "hi-fi" revolution of the post war era. It is commonly accepted that the use of reverb, whether natural room, chamber, or plate, practically defined the "hi-fi" era of music.

An engineer named Bill Fine brought back the popularity of natural reverb as an effect by putting a single mic in a large hall to capture the ambience of a recording. The recording was released on Mercury's "Living Presence" record.
 It was UA's own Bill Putnam, Sr., who was the first to use artificial reverb creatively on a pop recording in 1947, with the use of the first reverb chamber (the studio bathroom!). The result was a huge hit by The Harmonicats called "Peg o' My Heart" on his own Universal label. Having the ability to control reverb amount and turn the effect on and off at will was a major breakthrough, and a big part of the record's sound. Bill went on to build dedicated chambers for his studio in Chicago, as well as his later LA studios. Chamber reverb is to this day a technological and architectural art all to itself. The sound he created captured the listening public's imagination, and artificial reverb was popularized as a production tool for the recording environment; but for most of the fifties, room recording and echo chambers were the only options.
 However, German company EMT (Elektromesstecknik) made a huge breakthrough in 1957 with the release of the EMT 140 Reverberation Unit—the first plate reverb. EMT was birthed from the Broadcast Technical institute in Nuremburg and the Institute for Broadcast Engineering in Hamburg. EMT in its day was by far the most popular developer and manufacturer of artificial reverb solutions for the recording industry. From the first prepackaged artificial plate reverb system, to the early (and arguably best sounding) EMT 250 digital reverb, EMT was the forerunner of the field.</p>
