      <p>David Frazier has been making music all his life. He is part of a huge community in Marquette that produces music weekly. He is extremely avid on posting his music on soundcloud so that it can be feautured on anything from skate edits to collage style videos. Dave pairs his music and art together frequently. His list of inspirations is endless. Dave sees beauty in everything and anything and he channels that realization into his everyday craft. He keeps lots of sentimental things lying around his home and bedroom for sparks of inspiration as well.

    <p> "I think of my music as a gift to humanity. I channel my inner demons and formulate them into a musical divine concauction. I do a little bit of everything, ya know?My voice is angelic. My hair is too, as people say, haha. Everything about music thrills me completely, especially in jam sessions. You never really know what you're going to create. I am truly in love with sound and all that it has come to be." -Trevor Shanahan </p>
    <p> "Sound huh? Sound? I create it. I live with it. It's a need, a necessity. What would people even be without sound? It is how we communicate. It is how we show love and share our voices. We would be nothing without the gift of sound. It is a revelation and a calling and a job for me." -David Frazier</p>
