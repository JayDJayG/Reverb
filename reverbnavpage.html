    <h2>Reflecting Sound</h2>
    <p>One thing our brain senses from reverberation is the geometry of the  room where music is being played. Evidence suggests that the size of a  room, sensed through audio cues such as reverberation, affects our  emotional response to neutral and nice sounds. We tend to perceive small  rooms as being calmer, safer, and more pleasant than large spaces. Moderate reverberation added to music gives us a sense of listening  indoors. Is one of the reasons for liking reverberation is that it makes  us feel enclosed and safe from the outside world?</p>
    <p>But music producers often go further, adding more reverberation to give the illusion that the guitar or vocalists are playing from the back of a large venue.  Is this liked because it takes us back to a favourite gig and conjures  up an image of being around other people enjoying themselves? Afterall,  one of the theories for why we have evolved music making is that it is a social glue, a way to bring early humans together into a close-knit community.</p>
    <p>Moderate reverberation is certainly appreciated by musicians because  it helps blend the sound and smooth transitions between notes. I  recently played my saxophone in Salfords anechoic chamber while  showing visitors around. I hated having all my small errors exposed  when my fingers didn't quite move between notes in perfect coordination.  Is that what is behind a love of reverberation, simply that it just  makes music making easier?</p>
